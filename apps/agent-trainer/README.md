# App: Agent Trainer

## Purpose
The `agent-trainer` acts as a "compiler." It takes a structured `LearnedTask` and converts it into a final, executable `Agent` that can perform the automation.

## Inputs
- **`LearnedTask`:** Consumes a `LearnedTask` object generated by the `task-learner`.

## Outputs
- **`Agent`:** Produces a single `Agent` object. The `payload` of this agent will be an executable artifact, such as a JavaScript file for Playwright or a compiled WASM module.

_See `shared/src/types.rs` for the full data structure definitions._
