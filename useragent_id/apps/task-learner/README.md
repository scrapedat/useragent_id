# App: Task Learner

## Purpose
The `task-learner` is the "brain" of the system. It takes the raw data from the `user-monitor` and transforms it into a structured, logical, and human-understandable task.

## Inputs
- **`Recording`:** Consumes a `Recording` object generated by the `user-monitor`.

## Outputs
- **`LearnedTask`:** Produces a single `LearnedTask` object. This object represents a cleaned-up, de-duplicated, and logical sequence of `AutomationStep`s that can be used for training an agent.

_See `shared/src/types.rs` for the full data structure definitions._
